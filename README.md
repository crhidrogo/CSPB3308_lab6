# Lab 6: Flask Tutorial
Please install Flask on the machine of your choice and work through the Flask quickstart up through the section "static files":

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#installation

https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/

Create your own project with

- At least four working routes
- At least one route with a <variable_name>
- At least one static file (can be a .txt file)
- Turn in your zipped flask folder with the application.

You do NOT need  to do the sections after "static files", although feel free to read through them as you like.
